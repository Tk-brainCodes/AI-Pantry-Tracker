üìù **How It Works**
Pantry Tracker allows users to manage their pantry items through a user-friendly interface. Users can add items by filling out a form with the item's name, quantity, expiry date, category, and an optional image. The application stores this information in Firebase Firestore and allows users to upload images to Firebase Storage. The app also includes a camera capture feature, enabling users to take photos of pantry items directly. Using AI, the app classifies items based on images to suggest names and categories. Users can also edit or delete items as needed, making it easy to keep their pantry organized.
